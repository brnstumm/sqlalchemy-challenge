# sqlalchemy-challenge

Overview:  Tasked with creating an analysis on the climate in Hawaii.  From the data, we need to focus on the last years worth of data to figure out the precipitation and temperature observation by month.  Once we analyzed the data, we created a Flask API based on the information found.

Findings: Most of the days observed were between the tempuratures of 70 and 80 degrees.  The precipitation was greatest around October and April in the years observed.

Resources:  Class notes/lectures/sample problems.  I utilized a tutor to help build the flask API needed to display the information.  Other sources are :https://strftime.org/ & https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-strftime-function/ to build the dates needed.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11830980/sqlalchemy-simple-example-of-sum-average-min-max
